## v2023.12.5
This is a followup security release. Upgrading is recommended.

### Backend
- When fetching activities, the JSON-LD profile is now enforced for responses with application/ld+json content type
- Incoming note edits with attachment and no alt text no longer get silently dropped

### Attribution

## v2023.12.4
This is a security release. Upgrading is therefore strongly recommended.

### Backend
- The content type of fetched activities is now enforced
- Fetched activities' IDs must now match the hostname of the final request URL (after redirects)

## v2023.12.3
### Release notes
This is a security release. Upgrading is strongly recommended, as is adding an instance-wide announcement informing your users that if they previously imported posts from Mastodon, they should check their imported post history for DMs and follower-only posts that should not be public.

### Vulnerability explanation
The Mastodon post import feature (that has been untouched since Iceshrimp was forked from Firefish last year) did not correctly validate/set post visibility on imported posts. Due to the nature of the vulnerability, it's impossible to reconstruct which posts have been imported, and therefore we cannot restrict access to them in an update.

### Backend
- Post imports have been disabled
- Existing posts that have the "hidden" visibility are now only accessible to the author

### Frontend
- The UI for post imports has been removed

### Miscellaneous
- The yarn version was updated to 4.1.0
- The helm chart was updated

## v2023.11
### Release notes
This release contains only very minor changes if you're upgrading from `v2023.11-pre5`, but for users who skipped the prereleases, lots has changed. Be sure to read the changelogs of all releases between the one you're upgrading from and this one, especially the sections on breaking changes.

The information below is an *aggregate* of all breaking changes and release highlights since the last stable release.

### Breaking changes
- Lists have been reworked, now only allowing followed users to be added, and support for proxy accounts has been removed. To allow users to follow any users they want to keep on their lists, the migration that removes all list members users are not following will only be activated in the release **after** the next stable release. It is therefore highly recommended to add an instance announcement informing your users of this change and advising them to follow any affected accounts and to use the new "hide from home timeline" list option if desired.
- The Mastodon client API now uses the same object identifiers as the Misskey API, as well as its own, separate OAuth backend. This means all existing sessions are now invalid. Please log out and back in again in your clients.

### Highlights
- The Mastodon client API backend underwent a full rewrite, dropping megalodon as a dependency. Expect:
    + Rich text formatting (mentions, links, hashtags, etc. are now properly formatted)
    + Significantly improved API responsiveness - performance was improved by a factor of 2-5x (or more!) depending on the endpoint
    + Better spec compliance & improved compatibility (we test against: Mona, toot!, Ice Cubes, Tusker, Feditext, Mastodon for iOS, Mastodon for Android/Megalodon/Moshidon, Tusky, Elk, Phanpy, Pinafore/Semaphore/Enafore and more)
- The Mastodon client API now supports the websocket streaming API
- Various bugs in the HTTP Link header pagination implementation were fixed

## v2023.11-pre2
### Highlights
- An oversight in the OAuth helper that was preventing login to work in some Mastodon clients was fixed.

## v2023.11-pre1
### New versioning scheme
From now on we will use a JetBrains-like versioning scheme. Since our release candidates are more of a release preview, they can now be identified by the `-pre` suffix, followed by a number that increments with each following release preview. To maintain lexical sort order with previous releases from this year, we're starting the release counter at 11. That makes this release `v2023.11-pre1`.

### Breaking changes
- The Mastodon client API now uses its own, separate OAuth backend. This means all existing sessions are now invalid. Please log out and back in again in your clients.

## v2023.10.11-rc1
### Highlights
- The Mastodon client API now supports the websocket streaming API
- Various bugs in the HTTP Link header pagination implementation were fixed

### Attribution
This release was made possible by project contributors: Laura Hausmann

## v2023.10.08-rc1
### Breaking changes
- The Mastodon client API now uses the standard alphanumeric ID format. This breaks pagination with existing Mastodon client sessions, if they cache user and/or post data. It is therefore strongly recommended that you either clear the client's cache (if it exposes such a button), its data (if your OS supports this), log out and in again, or in the worst case reinstall any clients with active sessions, especially if you notice strange timeline behavior or unexplained "Record not found" errors.

### Highlights
- The Mastodon client API backend underwent a full rewrite, dropping megalodon as a dependency. Expect:
    + Rich text formatting (mentions, links, hashtags, etc. are now properly formatted)
    + Significantly improved API responsiveness - performance was improved by a factor of 2-5x (or more!) depending on the endpoint
    + Better spec compliance & improved compatibility (we test against: Mona, toot!, Ice Cubes, Tusker, Feditext, Mastodon for iOS, Mastodon for Android/Megalodon/Moshidon, Tusky, Elk, Phanpy, Pinafore/Semaphore/Enafore and more)

### Bug Fixes
- The update checker now works properly with the new versioning scheme
- The control panel indicator is now displayed correctly
- Countless Mastodon client API bugs have been resolved

### Backend
